## Salary Dashboard

This Excel-based dashboard project was developed as part of my personal learning and skill-building journey in data analysis. The goal was to analyze a real-world dataset containing job market information for data and IT roles and to present the findings in a clear, interactive format.

**The dashboard allows users to explore:**

  - Median salaries across different job titles
  - Geographic salary variations via a world map
  - Job counts filtered by title, country, and schedule type
  - ailored insights based on user-selected filters

By combining advanced Excel features—such as charts, formulas, conditional logic, and data validation—I created a functional tool that not only showcases key trends but also reinforces my proficiency in data storytelling using Excel.
